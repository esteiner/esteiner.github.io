## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Month sections can be collapsed and expanded
On the order page, the header of each month section SHALL toggle the visibility of that month's orders. A collapsed section SHALL show only its header, and an expanded section SHALL show its header and its list of orders. Toggling one section SHALL NOT affect any other section.

#### Scenario: Collapse a month
- **WHEN** a month section is expanded and the user activates its header
- **THEN** that month's order list is hidden and only the header remains visible

#### Scenario: Expand a month
- **WHEN** a month section is collapsed and the user activates its header
- **THEN** that month's order list is shown again

#### Scenario: Other months are unaffected
- **WHEN** the user collapses one month section
- **THEN** all other month sections keep their current state

### Requirement: Month sections start expanded
Every month section SHALL be expanded when the order page is first shown.

#### Scenario: Initial page load
- **WHEN** the user opens the order page
- **THEN** all month sections show their orders

### Requirement: Collapse state is indicated and accessible
The month header SHALL show a chevron indicating whether the section is expanded or collapsed. When collapsed, it SHALL also show the number of orders in that month. The header SHALL be a button with `aria-expanded` reflecting the state, so it can be operated with the keyboard (Enter/Space).

#### Scenario: Collapsed header shows count
- **WHEN** a month section with 3 orders is collapsed
- **THEN** its header shows the month, a collapsed-state chevron and the count 3, and has `aria-expanded="false"`

#### Scenario: Keyboard toggle
- **WHEN** the month header has keyboard focus and the user presses Enter or Space
- **THEN** the section toggles between collapsed and expanded

### Requirement: Collapse state stays with its month
When the list of month sections is re-rendered while the page is open (e.g. after changing a filter), each section's collapse state SHALL stay with its month and SHALL NOT move to a different month.

#### Scenario: Filter removes a month
- **WHEN** the user has collapsed "August 2026", and then applies a filter that removes "September 2026" from the list
- **THEN** "August 2026" is still collapsed and no other month has become collapsed
